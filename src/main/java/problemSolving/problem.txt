Create a class called Box that include three pieces of information as instance variables
- height, width and depth(type double) of two boxes. Your class should have a constructor
and initializes the three instance variables.

Provide a method displayVol that will display the volume of two boxes. .....
Suppose the value of instance variables for the first box's are (10,10,10) and the second
